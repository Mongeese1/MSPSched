Welcome to our repositry for the MSP period 3 project on optimizing the MSP schedule

Our code serves as a tool to help students make decisions on their future careers at MSP as well as offer an alternative solution to the sometimes confusing presentation of the MSP course selection. We present a GUI that allows students to select 16 courses as they normally would at MSP, and then implements a backtracking algorithm to go through and offer all possible combinations of schedules that can be made under the constraints specified by the MSP schedule. 

To use our code, simply download the release, unzip it, and compile it using your preffered java IDE. once it's built simply run it and a java window should pop up with a menu bar allowing you to pick your preffered courses. Once you have made a selection of 16 courses that follow the MSP guidelines(LAS requirement, 4 3000 levels, etc.) the program will save a text file to your computer with all the possible combinations in a 1x16 array, where each two elements are together in a period.

The final build is in the MSPsched - copy folder
